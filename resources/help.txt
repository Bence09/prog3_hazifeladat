1. Objective:
   - The goal of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.

2. Setup:
   - The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating dark and light squares.
   - Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the first three rows closest to them.

3. Movement:
   - Pieces can only move diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square.
   - If a piece reaches the farthest row from its starting position, it is promoted to a "king."

4. Kings:
   - Kings can move diagonally both forward and backward.
   - To indicate a piece is a king, place another piece on top of it or flip it over.

5. Capturing:
   - If an opponent's piece is adjacent to a player's piece and there is an empty square directly on the other side, 
the player must jump over the opponent's piece and capture it.

6. Mandatory Captures:
   - If a capture move is available, the player must take it.

7. Winning the Game:
   - A player wins by capturing all the opponent's pieces or blocking them so they cannot make a move.
